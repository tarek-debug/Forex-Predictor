# CurrencyExchangeInsights

## Purpose
CurrencyExchangeInsights aims to enhance decision-making for traders and businesses by offering predictive insights and actionable recommendations on currency exchange rate movements. This project, leveraging a microservices architecture with machine learning models and API integrations for real-time data, serves as a comprehensive tool for navigating the complexities of the foreign exchange market.

## Microservices Architecture

### UI Container
- **Responsibility:** Serves the frontend interface of CurrencyExchangeInsights, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience. It includes:
  - **Login Page**: Secure authentication for accessing user-specific insights and history.
  - **Home Page**: Central dashboard for currency predictions, real-time data viewing, and initiating new queries.
  - **History Page**: Displays a log of past queries and predictions, offering users insights into their past decisions.
  - **Profile Page**: Allows users to manage their account details and preferences.
- **Technologies:** Utilizes web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for frontend development. The architecture supports SPA frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for dynamic content delivery.

### Gateway API Service
- **Responsibility:** Acts as the central interface for user interactions, directing requests to the appropriate services. It serves the frontend, enabling users to view predictions, set alerts, and customize their experience.
- **Technologies:** Flask for the API; HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend components.

### Prediction Service
- **Responsibility:** Employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for predicting future exchange rates based on historical data. Additionally, it generates and supplies graphical representations of predictions.
- **Technologies:** Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for constructing and training machine learning models.

### Data Storage Service
- **Responsibility:** Handles storage and retrieval of historical data requests and prediction outcomes, supporting queries for historical information and managing user-generated history.
- **Technologies:** Python and Flask for creating RESTful services, SQLite for data persistence.

## Deployment
- **Containerization:** Docker is employed to containerize each microservice, ensuring isolated environments and dependency management.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized services, with Helm charts facilitating deployment configurations.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction:** The Gateway API Service facilitates user requests for predictions, alerts, and system interactions through the frontend.
2. **Prediction Execution:** Continual model training within the Prediction Service enables the provision of updated exchange rate predictions and visualizations.
3. **Data Handling:** Historical and predictive data management is centralized within the Data Storage Service, ensuring dynamic and interactive content availability.
